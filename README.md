TRIO smartcontracts

Setup
Investor Wallets should be created before the crowdsale is initialized. Once the Contribution is finalized, ownership of the TRIO token is transferred to the owner of Contribution contract.
The owner should then unpause the TOKEN token so that the investor wallets can collectTokens after their vesting period is over.
